How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?

HORATIO

    Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.

MARCELLUS

    Is it not like the king?

HORATIO

    As thou art to thyself:
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
